Whats up guys! it's me Shawn here for another java tutorial. In this tutorial, we are going to look at how to
use for loop with Standard Array Traversal loop / Enhanced for loop, to touch all the elements in the array 
instead of writing multiple lines of code. We are going to use For loop and for each loop for this tutorial, 
so it will be fun!


1. Standard array traversal for loop

int[] ara = {1,2,3,4,5};

for(int i = 0; i ( ara.length; i++)
{
 System.out.println("The item is : " + ara[i]);
}


//comment it out.



2. Enhanced for loop 

for ( int copy : ara )
{
 System.out.println("The item is : " + copy);
}
