This video montage shows the rebana group Bina Karya rehearsing in Dasan Agung, West Lombok on 12 August 1997.

Bina Karya is a nine-member rebana drum group. The rebana is a tuned, kettle-shaped frame drum that comes in an array of sizes. Bina Karya is a combination of six rebana drummers beating out tight, interlocking patterns, a pair of large rebana producing low, gong-like tones, a set of mounted cymbals, and the fiery hand-drumming of the group's leader Bapak Harun. Lombok rebana style and repertoire is different from that of rebana ensembles in Sumatra, Java or Madura. Orthodox Muslim leaders who object to bronze instruments find the rebana group acceptable, and Bapak Harun believes that the rebana repertoire in Lombok is "original Sasak music" adapted to an instrumental format appropriate for Muslim society. Bina Karya are shown rehearsing Turide, a composition which may be performed at Muslim wedding celebrations and circumcision ceremonies. Despite its compelling rhythm, like all rebana music in Lombok, Turide never accompanies dance. Its title comes from the name of the village (south of Cakranegara in West Lombok) where the composition originated.
