Hundreds of members of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and Islam Defenders Troop (LPI) on Sunday evening again raided nightlife entertainment centers
which still operate in Ramadhan month. Actually, the institution entitled to do the raids is police, not civilians.

This act of vandalism against dim lighted stalls  was conducted by tens of members of  Bogor Islamic civilian organization, among others are FPI and LPI.
They also raided Parung transit hotel, but were blocked by the police. They then burned the banner and hotel's name plate. They asked places of nightlife entertainment and gambling spot within that hotel to be closed down.

In Tasikmalaya and Ciamis, West Java, members of FPI also raided food stalls
which operate during daylight. FPI members closed down each stall that was seen open. They also searched stalls selling liquor. Some policemen were even accompanying FPI members conducting that raid. Whereas raid is of police's authority.

It was so much different compared to Metro Central Jakarta Police who firmly dismissed FPI convoy while they were in a parade and monitored some nightlife entertainment centers. Central Jakarta Police said that raiding is within police's authority.
