java static keyword is to create class specific methods and properties. We can use static at following places:

1. static variable - useful to create constants
2. static method - useful to create utility methods
3. static block - useful to initialize static variables and load other resources before instance creation. We can access only class static variables and methods in static block.
4. static inner class - it's almost same as variable, we can create instance just like using static variable.
5. static method in interfaces - this was introduced in Java 8, so make sure you are on Java 8 or higher version otherwise you will get compile time error.
