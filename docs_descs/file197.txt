This is a Java tutorial on printing, retrieving input, and transforming it into a String. I know this is very basic, but I have more advanced lessons coming. 

Let me know if you like it, and contact me for any help/info.

or 
just message me through youtube, I will get back to you.

You should have JDK 5.0, because I will teach about user input through a Scanner class.
