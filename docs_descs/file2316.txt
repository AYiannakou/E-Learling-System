In this Java programming tutorial we're going to look at bit manipulation using the Java Integer class. Bit manipulation is used in error correction, compression, encryption and optimization algorithms. It's one of those things that's really important, or you won't see it at all. But it's really important.

There are many operators we use to manipulate bits, but as we saw in previous Integer class tutorials they don't work for instances. The operators are meant for primitives. To fix this, Java provides several methods for manipulating bits in the Integer class.
