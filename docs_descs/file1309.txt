In this lesson we'll look at how to define and use attributes in your Java classes.  These attributes can belong to either the class or the object, so we'll discus what that means and how you define it.  We'll also introduce behavior using a new concept called methods. By the end we should know how to create Java class methods and variables, and have our Duck class quacking!
