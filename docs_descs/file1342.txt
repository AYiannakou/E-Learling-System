This is a video tutorial on how to generate random numbers in Java, using the Math.random() method. This video explains on a very basic way how to use the function and generate a number in between any range of numbers.

I leave the code of this program, and you can compile it and run it using the name RandomNumbers.java when you save the file.
The code is the following: 


public class RandomNumbers{
 public static void main( String args[] ){
   System.out.println( "A random number is: " + Math.random( ) ); 
   System.out.println( "A random number between 0 and 10 is: " + 10 * Math.random( ) );
   System.out.println( "A random number between 50 and 60 is: " + 10 * ( 5 + Math.random( ) ) );
 } 
}
