This is a video demonstration for the Active Membranes P-System Plugin and the P-Lab software. The video has been done by the authors of the software: the CellNet Project Team. The plugin is GPL License and the P-Lab is BSD License, both are in beta testing. The CellNet Project attempts to simulate the computation of a cellular membrane machine (P-Systems) by means of a number of computers deployed across the Internet, trying to achieve a real massive parallelism. It is a University research project by two students of the University of Seville, for more information, visit: http://thecellnetproject.googlepages.com/
