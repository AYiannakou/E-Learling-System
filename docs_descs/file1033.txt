In this tutorial we explore the relationship between classes and objects in the Java programming language. We discuss common relationships between fields and methods, and present some example classes which will be turned into objects at run-time. As a core concept in object-oriented programming, a strong knowledge of classes and objects is essential for any Java programmer.
