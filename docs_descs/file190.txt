We can use a database which is accessed by two or more systems, to implement a way that systems can communicate with each other. Perhaps this is a more general concept which covers similar ground to other methods such as parameter passing, messages, and shared memory such as labelled common in Fortran.

We can make up our own examples, with some confidence that they can be converted to code in Prolog, Java, Cobol or another language.
