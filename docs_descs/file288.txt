Here we have the latest revision of the Tetris in Javascript game, with with graphics updated to something a bit smoother. All the blocks are now the right color (according to the standard), the next piece shows, and the Tetris-style "Random Generator" is implemented.

While some of the features follow the Tetris guidelines, others do not. For example, there will be no "infinite spin". The game also uses the NES-style scoring routine.

A demo of this game can be played by pointing your Wii at http://java.dnsalias.com/tetris/. Enjoy!
