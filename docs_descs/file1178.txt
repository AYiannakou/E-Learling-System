The sort method sorts the current ArrayList object based on the Comparator argument. The most widely used method for sorting an ArrayList is actually the sort method from the Collections class. The method signature for the sort method is not the same as the sort method in the ArrayList class. To use the Collections sort method, you will simply pass the ArrayList reference variable as the argument and the sort method will by default sort your ArrayList object in ascending order. There is another overloaded version of the sort method in the Collections class that takes a second parameter that is a Comparator, I will demonstrate how to use that flavor as well.
