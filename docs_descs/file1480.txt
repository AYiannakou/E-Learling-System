Ever wondered what differences exist between Java and PHP?
In order to show the many similarities between Java and PHP, I created a learning series.
Part one is available at http://ojambo.com/learn-java-and-php-part-1.
Part two is available at http://ojambo.com/primitive-data-types-of-java-and-php-part-2.
Part three is available at http://ojambo.com/arithmetic-operators-of-java-and-php-part-3.
Part four is available at http://ojambo.com/string-objects-of-java-and-php-part-4.
Part five is available at http://ojambo.com/control-structures-of-java-and-php-part-5.
Part six is available at http://ojambo.com/iteration-loops-of-java-and-php-part-6.

In the seventh part, I will show you array types in Java and PHP.
Four lessons will be about array syntax, array initializers, multi-dimensional arrays and printing arrays.
The seventh part ends after the "Array Types" program is compiled and executed.
