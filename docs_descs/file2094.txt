Array vs ArrayList is one of the very common Java interview Questions.  In this tutorial learn the major differences between  Array and ArrayList.

         Arrays Points

Array size is fixed during declaration.
Array can access using array name & index
Array can store primitives and objects.
Array has length field for finding total elements.
Array allows multidimensional data
Arrays only allow homogeneous data

       
  ArrayList  Point

ArrayList size is not fixed and growable.
ArrayList accesses data using get method and index
ArrayList can only store objects.  Wrapper needed for primitives.
ArrayList uses size() method to find the total elements.
ArrayList can only handle single dimensional data
ArrayLists without type parameter  allow all types of objects
