The add() method is very useful for appending and inserting elements into an ArrayList. There are two overloaded versions of the add() method. The first version has only one parameter and simply appends the parameter object to the end of the ArrayList. If you try to add an object that is not compatible with the class or interface specified as the type-variable, a compiler error will occur.
