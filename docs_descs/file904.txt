Imagine someone has asked you to create an application that reports that average high, median, and low temperature for your city.  You could create three variables for each month.  This would give you 36 variables to keep track of. Thats the three temperatures times twelve months.   Determining the average low temperature for April would mean you'd need to have special  code to match the selected month with the three variables for that month.  That sounds like alot of work.  Luckily there's a better way that I want to show you.  Java has a data 
structure called arrays.

Concepts: Java, Programming, variables, arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, java.util.Arrays
