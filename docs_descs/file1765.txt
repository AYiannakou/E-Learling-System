break statement in java can be used to get out of the loop such as for loop, while loop and do-while loop.
We can use break statement with label to get out of nested loops or multiple loops at once since break statement can be used to get out of a single loop only.
Finally break statement is used with switch-case to get out of the switch case, otherwise once a case is satisfied, further case conditions are not evaluated and gets processed.
You will look into all these example usage of break statement in this video through Eclipse java program.
