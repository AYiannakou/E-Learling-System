A Luke and Lorelai video (of course). It's sort of them remembering happy moments during the time they were broken up. The black and white clips are the memories (obciously). This song is by my friend's cousin's band, Brickfoot. They're really great and I love their songs and I thought "Epilogue" fit great when they were broken up, so I made this. Comments/ratings appreciated.

I do not own Gilmore girls or this song.

Song is "Epilogue" by Brickfoot.
