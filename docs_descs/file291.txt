The potato originated in the region of southern Peru. Potatoes were first domesticated in Peru between 3000 BC and 2000 BC. The potato was introduced in the Philippines during the late 16th century and to Java and China during the 17th century. It was well-established as a crop in India by the late 18th century and in Africa by the mid-20th century. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. China is now the world's largest potato-producing country, and nearly a third of the world's potatoes are harvested in China and India. Apart from Rice, Wheat and Corn, Potatoes is the 4th highly produced crop all over India.

The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial family (also known as the nightshades). The word potato may refer to the plant itself as well as the edible tuber. The potato is best known for its carbohydrate content (approximately 26 grams in a medium potato). The potato contains vitamins and minerals and the fiber content of a potato with skin (2 g) is equivalent to that of many whole grain breads, pastas, and cereals.

Cumin are heavily used in ancient Roman cuisine. It helps to add an earthy and warming feeling to cooking, making it a staple in certain stews and soups, as well as curries and chilli. Cumin's distinctive flavour and strong, warm aroma is due to its essential oil content. Cumin is famous for its medicinal qualities and digestive properties. It reduces superficial inflammation and pain. As potato creates flatulence or heaviness of stomach, jeera helps in digesting the food and normalizes the digestive system. "Reach vahrehvah at -
