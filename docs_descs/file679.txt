This tutorial introduces the concept of classes and objects. Following this procedure, we did an exercise involving creating two classes. In addition, getting user inputs through the Scanner class was also used to get two user inputs so they can be processed in the methods. A brief glimpse of methods were also discussed and used , which will be extended in more details in upcoming tutorials. The next tutorial will be devoted to finishing this exercise, as well as giving a thorough recap on different lines of the code. Enjoy!
