My Java programming tutorial series. This video is about arrays (basically tables to store multiple values). Please subscribe if you're into this, and PLEASE COMMENT if you have any questions or problems with my videos. I want to help and I want to make sure I'm explaining things clearly.

Thanks so much for watching. Be sure to check out more of my vids. :D
