Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented computer programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere  WORA meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to byte code Class file that can run on any Java virtual machine JVM regardless of computer architecture.
