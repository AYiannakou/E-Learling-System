Ever wondered what differences exist between Java and PHP?
In order to show the many similarities between Java and PHP, I created a learning series.
Part one is available at http://ojambo.com/learn-java-and-php-part-1.
Part two is available at http://ojambo.com/primitive-data-types-of-java-and-php-part-2.
Part three is available at http://ojambo.com/arithmetic-operators-of-java-and-php-part-3.

In the third part, I will show you arithmetic operators in Java and PHP.
Four lessons will be about variables, basic math, increment, and assignment shortcuts.
The third part ends after the "Arithmetic Operators" program is compiled and executed.
