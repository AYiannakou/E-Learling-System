In this programming exercise I`m trying to figure out how to sort arraylist and save its contents into text file. So, we have 3 major tasks:  1) Reading input from text file and filling arrayList with it;  2) Sort our arrayList using Collections.sort method; 3) and finally - save sorted arrayList into another text file as output.
