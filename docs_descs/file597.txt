Write a method that creates and initializes a two-dimensional array of primitive type double. The size of the array is determined by the arguments of the method, and the initialization values are a range determined by beginning and ending values that are also arguments of the method (so four arguments total). Create a second method that will print the array generated by the first method. In main(), test the methods by creating and printing several different sizes of arrays. -- asked by Raj on our Facebook profile (http://www.facebook.com/itcuties)
