Visuals were created by running a infinite loop using a Processing applet (similar to Java) to generate the original balls. The balls were then projected onto a screen. A video camera picks up the images of the projected balls and the sends the image back into Processing. The computer program detects the edges of the balls and tells the balls it is controlling to bump against them when they collide. Music by Photek
