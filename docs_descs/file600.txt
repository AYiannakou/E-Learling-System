In this lesson, we have discussed array based implementation of stack data structure.

Time complexity of push for dynamic array implementation:

If we start with an array of size 1 and keep doubling the size with each overflow, for n pushes.. cost of copy will be

 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + n/2 + n) 
 = n *( 1+ 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... 1/n)  -  taking out n 
= n*2   - the expression in bracket above will evaluate to 2. 

So, cost of copy in n pushes = O(n)
Cost of n normal pushes = O(n)  - each push takes constant time
Total cost of n pushes = O(n)
Average cost of 1 push = O(1).
