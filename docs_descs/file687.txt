This is more or less an updated version of an older tutorial I made for Java programming. The previous one got a lot of attention so I decided to improve on it and make this one. Let me know if you like it or would like to recommend some improvements I can do, anything really someone please talk to me. I'm just kidding I'm not lonely. I just make jokes every now and then.
