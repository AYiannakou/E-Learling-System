This video is the 19th in a web series that I am creating to help you learn Android programming so you can create apps and eventually how to learn to write games for android phones.  I want to explain things in a way that everyone can understand, even if you have no experience with Java, XML, C++, OpenGL, or as a matter of fact, any other programming language.   

If you do have a lot of experience with programming, these first videos will be really slow for you, but my goal is to get everyone sprinting, but for now we have learn to crawl.
