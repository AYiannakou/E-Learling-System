AMERICA'S BEST DANCE CREW back in 2005 =)
For everyone that keeps saying this isn't them... This IS the real JabbaWockeez. I've been a fan of them since 2003 and I was actually there when they performed this.. The masks are inspired from Media Sirkus AKA Demons of the Mind, an old school popping/strutting crew who has been dancing since the 70's.


Also, there are more than just 7 members in the Jabbawockeez. I think some of them just cant perform every time because of other responsibilities that they have. Jobs, family, other dance teams, ect.
