The Logical ! (not) operator is used to perform logical complement or negation operations on boolean variables, expressions, or method return values. That sort of techobabble makes this operator seem like it must have some amazing super powers. In reality, it simply changes the evaluation of a boolean value or result from true to false or false to true. Notice I stated, "evaluation of boolean value or result". It does not change the value of the variable. That is all the ! logical operator does.
