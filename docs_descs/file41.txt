Written in 1940 about Java's longest river, this is the best known of all Indonesian songs. It is the song I have in reserve when I travel in Indonesia and other Malay-speaking countries. Many times, while taking an evening stroll, I have been invited to join a group of young people sitting around with a guitar or two. Inevitably I will be asked to sing a song. If they want an English song I sing something simple like "Wooden Heart", but I usually end up singing "Bengawan Solo", which they always know. I have also sung it on a Pelni ship, with full backing of the ship's band - quite a novel experience.

I was honored to know that this video was shown on Indonesian television after the death of Gesang Martohartono.
