Java anagram program is very important program asked in java interview for freshers and experienced.
Two Strings are anagrams if they contain same characters but in different order.
Here are the steps to be followed to check two Strings are anagrams or not :
1) Take  two strings as input.
2) convert first string to character array .
3) Take each character from first string and get the index of that character in second string.If the index is present delete that character from second string.
4) Repeat the same step for all characters in First string .
5) Finally check the length of second string if the length is zero then both strings are anagrams else both are not anagrams.
