A single-dimensional (one-dimensional) array is basically a list of items of the same type. In Java, an array is an object. The length of the array is set when the array is created and that length is fixed cannot be changed later. An array consists of elements, each element can be modified by using its numerical index. Numeric indexes begin at the number 0, so the first element can be accessed at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on and so forth.
