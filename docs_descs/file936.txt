Welcome to my Java Recursion tutorial. In this video, I'm going to cover java recursion in 5 different ways. I figured if I show it using many different diagrams that it will make complete sense.

A recursive method is just a method that calls itself. As these calls are made the problem gets simpler until you reach a condition that leads to the method no longer making calls upon itself. This is known as the base case.
