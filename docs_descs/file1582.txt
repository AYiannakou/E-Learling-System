The Java language has several Unary operators, this tutorial will discuss the proper use of the increment and decrement operators. The increment operator is simply a pair of plus symbols ++ that are placed either before or after an operand (variable++ or ++variable). The decrement operator is simply a pair of minus symbols -- that are placed either before or after an operand (variable-- or --variable). They work by simply incrementing or decrementing the operand by one. These two operators are used quite often in many looping statements.
