3d array is actually a combination of 2 dimensional arrays.here i points to the total number of 3d arrays which in this program are 3.j points to one two dimensional array and k just keeps track of each row in a two dimensional array.Here i used enhanced-for loop which is used to print the element of a collection.x retrieves values from collection(e.g array is a collection (i will describe collections in later videos)) and is only a read only variable which means we cannot change the contents of a collection using this variable.
      Enhanced for-loop are executed efficiently by Java Virtual Machine and provide a short-cut means of execution of your loop.
