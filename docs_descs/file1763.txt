Learn about the while and do while loops in Java, two tools that will help you tremendously in all sorts of situations.
I talk about infinite loops using the true keyword, managing loops using the break and continue keywords, boolean tests as a condition in while loops, and do while loops that guarantee that your code runs at least once even if the condition is false.
Watch this tutorial and learn everything you need to know about these concepts in the Java programming language.
