In many ways, a boolean method (i.e., a method which returns a boolean value) is no different than any other method which returns a value.  They might warrant special treatment because: (a) despite the simple nature (true/false) of boolean values, it can still be a point of confusion for new programmers, and (b) a well written and named boolean method can be very useful when combined with conditional statements (e.g., if/else, or various conditional loops).
