ABSTRACT

We propose to add Closures to the Java Programming Language. Closures simplify the use of APIs that rely on anonymous class instances, such as the concurrency APIs and callbacks. More importantly, closures support control abstractions, which are APIs that act as programmer-defined control constructs. This talk describes the proposed language extension and its design rationale, and shows how it will affect existing and future APIs.  Credits: Speaker:Neal Gafter
