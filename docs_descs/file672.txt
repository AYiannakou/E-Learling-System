Java Interview Question And Answer Explain Java Class and Object Java Interview

Difference between 'Class' and 'Object' in Java ? Java Interview Question and Answer ?

The terms 'class' and 'object' are absolutely related to one another, but each term holds its own distinct meaning. 

The term 'class' refers to the actual written piece of code in which the class is defined. A class is a static piece of code that consists of attributes which don't change during the execution of a program -- like the method definitions within a class.

Please remember  - "An object is an instance of a class ".

Every object must belong to a class. Objects are created and eventually destroyed -- so they only live in the program for a limited time.

An instance of the Animal class would be a specific animal -- like a lion, a cat, or a camel. These instances of the Animal class would be called objects.
