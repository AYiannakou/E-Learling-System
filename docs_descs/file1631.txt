In this video, I'll cover how work with a linked list in java. I'll show you how they work in 4 different ways.

We'll cover how to create them, what a link is, how to add and delete links, how to search through them and a whole bunch more. The basics you need to understand at the end are that: 

1. A Link is an Object 
2. Each Link has a reference to another Link in the List 
3. The LinkedList has only a reference to the last Link added to it.
