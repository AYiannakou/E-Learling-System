Three different loops
* For loop
* While loop
* Do while loop

The while loop is  the loop. When the expression is tested and the result is false, the loop body will be skipped and the first statement after the while loop will be executed.

A do while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
