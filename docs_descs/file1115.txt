In this tutorial we look at the three main types of loops in Java: the while loop, the do-while loop, and the for loop.

The debugger is also introduced. It allows us to see exactly how Java executes loops.

There is another form of the for loop that is shorthand for iterating over every element of a collection that will be covered in the future.

You can also achieve similar looping functionality using something called recursion, which will also be covered in the future.
