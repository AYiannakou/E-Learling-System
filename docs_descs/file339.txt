Joinmax doggy alternately sits down and stands up under control of  Warplan, a simple planner written in Prolog (author: David Warren 1975!).

The method for standing up was discovered by accident. The servos on the bot are not strong enough to lift even 1/2 the dog directly off the ground. 

An integer overflow showed me it was still possible to get up by drawing rear legs under body for leverage.
