This video shows how abstract classes can be used to make your code more logical.  They force the programmer to code specific methods when they inherit from them.  For example, Java programmers are forced to have an actionPerformed method when they inherit from JFrame (extends JFrame).  An interface is just an abstract class which does not have coded methods or variables.  There is one problem though - a program can only extend one other class (inherit from one class).  This is called multiple inheritance.  How you overcome this is explained in the video at http://youtu.be/o8lgEM8TENM.
