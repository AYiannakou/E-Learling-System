In this lesson you learn the basics of for loops and how switch cases work. Sorry it took a while to upload this video, I recorded it back in the beginning of October but have been putting it off until recently. I will attempt to continue with the tutorials and put up as much content as I can. Thanks to everyone for the support and following along on my tutorials.
