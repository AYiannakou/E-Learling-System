This Java Tutorial video talks about static variables in Java that are maintained as a single copy across all objects, in other words, when one object modifies the static variable, every other object that will be created can see that change, static variables belong to a class rather than an individual object. static blocks are used to initialize static variables and get called before any constructor or before any object has been created.
