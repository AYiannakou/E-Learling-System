Variables are a central concept in all programming languages.  In Java, because the language is strongly typed, variable typing is an important concept.  This video tutorial reviews declaring variables, initializing variables, selecting the appropriate variable type and manipulating variables with operators.  In addition, this video reviews declaration of String objects and concatenation. LearntoProgram's Java tutorial series will teach you the basics of Java programming.
