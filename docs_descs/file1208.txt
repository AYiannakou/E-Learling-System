Nineteenth episode of my programming series dedicated to teaching you Java! After another break we're back with more tutorials. We get an important lesson out of the way today, covering Bitwise and Bitshift operators, which do require a bit of knowledge of binary, yet have so many worthwhile uses. Please enjoy, subscribe, like, and favorite if you enjoyed the lesson. And always, leave a comment and tell me how you feel.
